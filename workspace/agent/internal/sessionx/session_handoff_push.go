// "Push, then send" for a member handoff (ADR 0057, issue #2072).
//
// When the push gate blocks because the branch is unpushed or was never pushed, the owner
// can ask for the push from the offer modal instead of leaving it to push by hand. The CP
// calls this endpoint on the owner's own click, inside the offer request, and then asks
// handoff-context again: whether the offer may go stays this Agent's verdict.
//
// What is pushed is deliberately narrow: the commit the owner was shown, to the branch of the
// same name on origin, and only when that is where git would send it — the push URL is
// origin's own URL and any upstream is origin's branch of the same name, so the offer's
// remote and branch name exactly where the commit went. Never with force, tags or
// submodules. Uncommitted changes are not touched. The workspace's own git setup supplies the
// credentials (the global credential helper), and the repository's hooks run: a pre-push hook
// that refuses is reported as git printed it.
//
// The route accepts only a request the CP marked (memberorigin, ADR 0113): AGENT_TOKEN is in
// every session's shell, and a push from here must be the owner's own click.
